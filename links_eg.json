Among these, Radio Frequency (RF) sensing stands out for its cost-effective and non-intrusive moni- toring of human activities and environmental changes. However, traditional RF sensing methods face significant challenges, in- cluding noise, interference, incomplete data, and high deployment costs, which limit their effectiveness and scalability.
