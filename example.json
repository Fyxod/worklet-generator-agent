{'Title': 'Federated Pruning for Edge Devices', 'Problem Statement': 'Federated learning models face deployment challenges on edge devices due to their large size. Pruning offers a solution but is complicated within federated settings needing careful optimization.', 'Goal': 'The goal is to create federated learning algorithms with model pruning, minimizing model size while preserving accuracy and optimizing communication. The aim is ensuring effective edge deployment.', 'Expectations': 'Participants will implement federated averaging incorporating pruning, evaluate the performance using suitable datasets, analyze communication overhead, and report on various pruning approaches with comparative performance analysis.', 'Training/Prerequisite': 'Federated learning basics, model pruning techniques, familiarity with PyTorch/TensorFlow, understanding of communication protocols.', 'Difficulty': 7, 'Reference Work': [{'title': 'Federated Learning: Challenges, Methods, and Future Directions', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04977'}, {'title': 'Pruning neural networks at scale', 'link': 'https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2018/file/54473917af4f6007cd6ddc7c29aa472c-Paper.pdf'}]}
