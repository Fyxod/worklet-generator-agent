Kolata quotes McCarthy as writing: \"This is AI, so we don't care if it's psychologically real\".[19] McCarthy recently reiterated his position at the AI@50 conference where he said \"Artificial intelligence is not, by definition, simulation of human intelligence\".[20].

G\u00f6del finds (b) implausible, and thus seems to have believed the human mind was not equivalent to a finite machine, i.e., its power exceeded that of any finite machine. He recognized that this was only a conjecture, since one could never disprove (b). Yet he considered the disjunctive conclusion to be a \"certain fact\".
