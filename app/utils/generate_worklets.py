### 🔹 **Instructions:**
- Ensure that the new worklets are **unique yet thematically aligned** with the given worklets.
- **Follow the exact format** below for each new worklet.
- **Do not fabricate unrealistic or fictional ideas**—keep them practical and feasible.
- **Exclude specific names of people, organizations, or brands**.

---

### ** Structure of Each Worklet Idea:**
1. **Problem Statement**: Clearly describe the problem this worklet aims to address.
2. **Goal**: Define the objective and intended outcome.
3. **Expectations**: Describe what participants are expected to do or accomplish.
4. **Training/Prerequisite**: List any required knowledge, skills, or prior learning needed.

### ** Additional Guidelines:**
**Maintain originality**—do not copy or modify existing worklets too closely.  
**Keep ideas well-structured and clear** to ensure easy comprehension.  
**Avoid redundancy**—ensure each generated worklet introduces a fresh perspective.  
**Ensure coherence and practicality**—ideas should be applicable in real-world scenarios.  
**Do not introduce unrelated topics**—stick to the context of the given worklets.  

Respond strictly in JSON format as shown below:
