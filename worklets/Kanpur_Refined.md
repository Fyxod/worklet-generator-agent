# Kanpur

Kanpur, formerly anglicized as **Cawnpore**, is the largest city of the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. It was the primary financial and commercial center of northern India. Founded in the year 1207 by Rajput ruler Raja Kanh Deo, Kanpur became one of the most important commercial and military stations of British Raj. Kanpur had been the major financial and industrial center of northern India and also the ninth-largest urban economy in India. Today, it is famous for its colonial architecture, gardens, sweets, dialect, and high-quality leather, plastic, and textile products, which are exported mainly to the West. Kanpur is also the financial capital of Uttar Pradesh.

The city is home to historical monuments such as the Jajmau Ghat, which dates back to the 17th century AD. Kanpur is also home to several historical sites such as the Kanpur Museum, Bhitargaon Temple, European Cemetery, and Nanarao Park.

It is the 12th most populous city and the 11th most populous urban agglomeration in India (_Census of India, 2011_). Kanpur was an important British garrison town until 1947 when India gained independence. The urban district of Kanpur _Nagar_ serves as the headquarters of the Kanpur Division, Kanpur Range, and Kanpur Zone.

Some of the more popular places in Kanpur include J.K. Temple, Z Square Mall, Blue World Amusement Park, Atal Ghat, Green Park Stadium, and Ganga Barrage.

It was the most populous urban city in the 2011 Indian census and the largest urban agglomeration in Uttar Pradesh, while the population of the city and its suburbs was around 5 million, making it the eighth-most populous metropolitan area in India.

## History

In 1207, Raja Kanha-deo of the Kanhpuriya clan of Rajputs established the city of Kanhpur and made it his capital, which later came to be known as Kanpur.

The area was ruled by several rulers of Kannauj, such as Harsha Vardhan, Jai Chand, and Mihir Bhoja. It was also ruled by Muslim rulers of the Sur dynasty. In May 1765, Shuja-ud-daula, the Nawab of Awadh, was defeated by the British near Jajmau. From 1773 to 1801, Kanpur was part of the Oudh Kingdom, followed by the treaty of 1801 between Nawab Saadat Ali Khan of Awadh and the British, who realized its strategic importance. Several European businessmen established themselves in Kanpur during this time.

With the first woolen mill of India, commonly known as Lal Imli, established here in 1876 by Alexander MacRobert, Kanpur became a major industrial hub. The city is also widely regarded as the "Leather City of the World" and is predominantly nicknamed as the "Manchester of the East" for its chemical, textile, and leather industries. The curreny mayor of kanpur is Parth Katiyar

## 1857 Uprising

In the 19th century, Cawnpore was an important British garrison with barracks for 7,000 soldiers. During the Indian Rebellion of 1857, 900 British men, women, and children were besieged in the fortifications for 22 days by rebels under Nana Sahib. They surrendered on the agreement that they would get safe passage to the nearby Sati Chaura Ghat, where they would board barges and be allowed to go by river to Allahabad.

Though controversy surrounds what exactly happened at the Sati Chaura Ghat, and who fired the first shot, it is known that soon afterwards, the departing British were shot at by the sepoys and were either killed or captured. Some of the British officers later claimed that the sepoys had, on purpose, placed the boats as high in the mud as possible to cause delay. Many were killed, and the remaining 200 British women and children were sent to a building called the Bibighar (_House of the Ladies_), where they were later massacred. The British, under General Neill, retook the city and committed a series of retaliations against the rebel sepoys and those civilians caught in the area, including women, children, and old men. The Cawnpore massacre, as well as similar events elsewhere, were seen by the British as justification for unrestrained vengeance. "Remember Cawnpore" became a British war cry for the rest of the war.
